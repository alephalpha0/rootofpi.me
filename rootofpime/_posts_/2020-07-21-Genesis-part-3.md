I'm walking to IHOP on University along Rosedale. It's 7:50 in the morning and I'm going to do something productive with my day for the first time in about 7 months. I've been up all night trying to calm my nerves and get my mind under wraps. And honestly all I can think about right now is just how fucking goofy people's faces look while they're driving and looking into the Sun. I'm still a little bit high so of course this slut comes out. With it being late July in Texas, the temperature is already up in the upper 80s this early in the morning and the humidity is sweltering. I'm sweating like a whore in church. I've already taken off my shirt nice walking half naked down the road. Got some good looks like a few people just stare down as I pass by. Little something you can just write my son's idea that I am going to do something that I have not done in a very long time not is devote my time of my energy the somebody else did you end up for pay. Too obvious outcome, either I make it through what's someone's going to die today
