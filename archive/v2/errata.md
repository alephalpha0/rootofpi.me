> Open source is the way to go. It is a philosophy as well as a reality.  
 
This site would not be in existance if it weren't for the ability to right click on any page on the internet and `view-source` to gaze into the innards of a site. [Github](https://github.com) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) have been wonderful treasure troves of inspiration as well as useful repositories of tools to build things and hack things and figure out how things work.  

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate and maintain the code infrastructure as well as the page and post generation and archival.  

[Rursus Compact Mono](https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/rursus-compact-mono) is the font on display, and is used from [Font Library](https://fontlibrary.org) under the [GNU General Public License](https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).  

Rootofpi's source code is available in [my own repository](https://github.com/alephalpha0/rootofpi.me/) on Github. I have yet to attach a license to it, but it will be a `share and share alike` based license.  

The text editor of choice for clacking away on my bluetooth keyboard is [micro text editor](https://micro-editor.github.io). It's a damn good text editor and I will recommend it to my dying breath.   

Since I began terrorizing the etherspace of the world wide web in 2002, I have been a staunch supporter of [no www](https://no-www.org).
