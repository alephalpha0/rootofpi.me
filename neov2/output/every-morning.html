  <div class="article_text" id="post">
    <p>This is finally a glimpse of what I&#8217;ve been slowly building towards in my addled easily distractable manner, fudging about in termux, trying to get my laptop on a decent stable distro of linux, and searching high and low through the silver waves of ethernet for pieces of self-discolsure. i&#8217;m going to spend the next couple hours in <a href="https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy">Bitsy</a> and try to tell a somewhat personal and yet interactive story. seem&#8217;s to be the most simple of plans, but it took me a fair minute to find an appropriate container to do&nbsp;this. </p>
<p>I ran across Bitsy about a month ago, and the ethos and vibe I got from it was that the developer wants it to be used to tell personal stories through interactive &#8220;gameplay.&#8221; sounds right up my alley. some of the best stories I have ever encountered have been through video games of various sorts. Usually in a genre or format that would not be a usual suspect for deep all-encompassing story immersion: see Risk of Rain and Nier:&nbsp;Automata. </p>
<p>Bitsy is simple and uncluttered on the first &#8220;boot&#8221; into the editor. You have a welcome blurb with links, your scene editor, sprite/block/item editor, color selection and a save component. Tools are readily available from a menu along the top and you&#8217;re left to your own devices to discover what the tool can do for you. I&#8217;ve spent a fair amount of time creating my first scene and setting up the dialog that plays to tell the story. As I explore more of the application, the more intricacies were revealed and it becomes more complex each time I click a new&nbsp;button.</p>
<p>I think I named my first game, &#8220;Every morning at 6:38&#8230;&#8221; I want to in a slightly overt fashion capture my state of mind that happens when I&#8217;ve been up all night by myself following rabbit holes and find that daybreak is upon me and a new day is beginning while the old day is still progressing. A singular feeling fills me up knowing that the real world is waking and the machinery of day-to-day starts itself up, while I continue to coexist with myself onboard the Starship Shelled. The idea of the game is a linear path that the player walks along and see&#8217;s various scenes of the &#8220;real world&#8221; while random musings of mine pop up at different squares they could walk&nbsp;over.</p>
