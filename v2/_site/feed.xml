&lt;h1 id=&quot;this-is-my-story-there-are-many-like-it-but-this-one-is-mine&quot;&gt;This is my story. There are many like it, but this one is mine.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m setting out to do with this online blog of mine is not groundbreaking or cutting edge. Other, better, writers than I have created amazing meldings of lazer focused sociological commentary and literary wit and grace when they put pen to paper. To be honest, weree I to take the time to deeply contemplate my motives and the scope of what I hope to accomplish in the most meagre way feasible… I wwant to stop now. It’s going to be awkward but honnest going forward from here. I’m going to try and not sugar coat details, or omit things to protect and oblige the social norms and mores I’ve been bucking for the past decade. Oh fuck, I’m pompous.. I’m also going to try and not make these postings into a pity party or go the other extreme and  glorify my actions, thoughts, and lifestyle. Hunter S. Thompson keeps running through my mind, and for good reason. He is one of the archetypes I will undoubtedly continue to compare each and every word i type out against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read his essays and novels, there was not many moments where I really wanted to be there in the thick of his insanity with him. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas remains to this day one of the scariest and hardest to sit still and watch movies I’ve ever seen. Fuck, tangential as fuck. THE POINT. My goal, my scope, my hope for cartharsis is thus: I am a 36 year old queer male who is near hopelessly addicted to methamphetamine. I have been in various stages and swatches of the spectrum of actively using it since roughly the beginning of 2011. Further clarification is that I was also diagnosed HIV positive, with a cd4 count and viral load that placed me well within the scope and classification of AIDS on the ides of March 2011. The timing of when I rolled my first bowl is not completely fixed in chronological timing for me, but I know that they are basically dovetailing coconcurrent issues in my psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly. I am not alone in my tweakertude. There is an almost unspoken, untalked about, unrecognized epidemic that is deeply and thoughly entrentched in the gay community. PNP. Party and Play. WhaTs up man? How’s your night been? Wanna smoke and fuck all night? This is where my hope and concern lie. It is a highly insular society that exists within the already highly cliqueish and plastic-superficial-worshipping society that the gay culture has sadly become.&lt;a href=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; There are undoubtedly unnumbered reasons for it, but unless you have had the misfortune to be introduced into the pnp lifestyle chances are you will remain oblivious to the breadth and depth of the epidemic. I admit that it has been a good minute since I allowed myself the time to be nerdy and skim through  collegiate quarterliess, but I’m willing to stake my large share of shit-all that there are not many inquiries being generated and   into either the root causes OR the possible theraputic solutions and methods to mitigate the trickling loss of human souls and life that will continue to grow in magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my past times, if not completely obvious to all who care to observe, is raging against the gay reptilian agenda. It gives me peace of mind. Until next time,
Space Cowboy  over and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Just as a side note, it deeply hurts my soul to think about what the yearly Pride celebration has become for the doe-eyed faggots of today. Smirnoff floats, official sponsorship of Levis Shit-Kicker 501s and shadey-heavy-handed faux Drag Queens abound while counter culture queers and punks and the stringinent anti heteronormative nonpuritanical gay men are no longer allowed a seat in the culture’s zeitgeist. the stonewall riots were for naught. we took it upon ourselves to subsumme and internalize the heteronormative mentality and thus made our existance less threatening to straight mainstream society at large. But you know… The Gays get Mimosas every week at sunday brunch, so it’s all good..&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="methful life" /><category term="manifesto" /><category term="space cowboy" /><category term="queer not gay" /><summary type="html">This is my story.

It’s 7:50 in the morning and I’m going to do something productive with my day for the first time in about 7 months. I’ve been up all night trying to calm my nerves and get my mind under wraps. And honestly all I can think about right now is just how fucking goofy people’s faces look while they’re driving and looking into the Sun. I’m still a little bit high so of course the slut comes out. With it being late July in Texas, the temperature is already up in the upper 80s this early in the morning and the humidity is sweltering. I’m sweating like a whore in church. I’ve already taken off my shirt and there I go walking half naked down the road. Got some good double takes and long stares from commuters as I pass by. I am going to do something that I have not done in a very long time: that is devote my time and my energy to somebody else’s schedule and profit for pay. Two obvious outcomes here, either I make it through and adjust to being on a timeclock, or someone’s going to die today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="working" /><category term="feeling myself" /><summary type="html">I'm sweating like a whore in church.

Too much of nothing and I’m bleeding out stress. I exude and become one with it. Mind stress. I’m clean but not sober, haven’t had any meth in a good while, and I’m losing my goddamn mind. Time slowly marches onward and I feel the slow passing of the seconds like knife cuts across my skin. I can’t go anywhere due to COVID, can’t have any company due to COVID, so I just sit in my room or sleep in my room. The only break in the monotony are meal times (8, 12, 5) and when I go outside in the heat to smoke a black and mild or vape on my stick. I’m broke, the very definition of broke, and that limits my options even further. I’m stuck in this moment and this moment will never end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="sobriety" /><category term="mental state" /><category term="love in the time of COVID19" /><summary type="html">Time slowly marches onward and I feel the slow passing of the seconds like knife cuts across my skin.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">hello</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/07/10/hello/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="hello" /><published>2020-07-10T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-07-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/07/10/hello</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/07/10/hello/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-daunting-again-the-put-words-out-onto-a-screen-ive-tried-this-so-many-damned-times-since-my-heyday-in-high-school-to-journal-into-the-void-to-try-and-generate-a-space-in-the-cyber-ether-that-im-proud-of-or-at-least-enjoy-cultivating-and-maintaining&quot;&gt;it’s daunting again, the put words out onto a screen. i’ve tried this so many damned times since my heyday in high school. to journal into the void. to try and generate a space in the cyber ether that i’m proud of. or at least enjoy cultivating and maintaining.&lt;/h3&gt;
