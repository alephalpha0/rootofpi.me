I"A<p>Originiated circa 2003, Rootofpi has been the digital self-curated domain of DK3. 
Rootofpiâ€™s  hallmarks are 1) its history is handcoded and mostly on the fly and off the cuff, 2) the only interests and motives operating behind its existance are self introspection, self growth, and self amusement, and 3) the term rootofpi itself; inherently nonlogical and nonsensicle. 
It is my home is cyberspace that has been absent for over a decade.
I am incredibly satisfied and delighted to have it back in operation and broadcasting into the nether.</p>

<p>I come in peace.</p>
