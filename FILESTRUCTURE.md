# As of 2021-02-10 this is how I want to try and maintain my site directory. Minimalism is always the hoped for and sought after reality that never fulfills itself. 

( ) Take to heart the process of SSGs: content and layout are separated and maintained at a distance from each other. 
( ) Make it easy for myself to generate new content and lessen the cost of entry just to write down some damn thoughts. 
( ) Keep in mind my desire to use pictorals and images more fluently.

+ This will be kept, cause I still have dreams of being a cam-whore and maintaining my own naughty site. May be swept into archive someday.

+ The resting grounds of all content/layouts that have gone before.

+ Need to extrapolate the content (ascii images) from my cobbled together HTML and put the ascii into content/ and push asciiV1 into archive/.

+ WHERE THE CONTENT LIVES! logs, posts, articles, rants, images, galleries.. Everything I do that isn't the form of the site.

+ I liked this layout and wanted to put it into liquid templating etc etc. Pages and etc will be placed into content/ and work will be done to make a Pelican theme of my own from its layout.

+ First forray into using Pelican, mainly a blog without anything else. Last iteration where rootofpi and aa0.neocities are separate places in my digital garden. Will be put into archive/ with love.

+ My last hurrah with Jekyll. Needs to be scraped and put into content/ and archive/.

+ The barebones Pelican site I was fudging around with. I think it's just going to silently go bye bye.
