      <h2 class="inline">Introduction</h2> and progress so far. I have been attempting to focus my will and mind onto picking up and developing the <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> programming language since mid-summer of this year. I quickly became overwhelmed by my attempt to jump into the waters unaided by going down the <a href="https://awesome-python.com/">awesome-python</a> list and opening every link that appealed to my wonder. My natural reaction to information overload is to deify the object and source of the information and to immediately over-complicate the path to seeking out that knowledge and get frustrated.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="inline">Eventually,</h2> I came across a few decent project-based tutorials/introductions to Python and started following along with them and began to learn. Three sources that I have stuck with and followed so far are 1) the <a href="https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python">30 Days of Python</a> GitHube repo, 2) <a href="http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/"><u>Invent With Python, 4th Edition</u></a> which is offered for free as a webpage-book (not sure that's the official term), and 3) a epub file of <a href="https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e">Python Crash Course</a> I got from an old <a href="https://humblebundle.com">Humble Bundle Unix eBook bundle</a>. 
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="inline">I'm not sure</h2> that my self-amusing reasons for wanting to learn to code can be fully realized within the Python language. My main goal to be achieved is creating Generative Art pieces/installations/scenes/etc/etc/etc. I'm drawn to the vast data visualization modules Python and its community have created, as well as data visualization being one of Python's numerous "realms of expertise." I have my sights set on looking into PyGame, Pyglet as well as any and all GLSL
and shader Python libraries I can come across, once my base is firm and secure.
