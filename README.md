# [https://rootofpi.me](rootofpi.me) is living again.

> It's my site. :shrug:. Whatta staring at? Take a picture, it'll last longer.  

 ### A short history of rootofpi: 
 * 2002ish: Inception. Came from chibidave.net, where I was doing a personal site with some subdomains for friends. Originally rootofpi.org, as I expanded the concept of the site to be a collective. 
 * end of 2003ish to August 2020: domancy period. life happened, didn't have use for a digital domain.. 
 * August 2020: rootofpi.me begins the rebirth of my personal space in cyberspace. A nanoc blog is cobbled together prior to this on my phone. 
 * Late August 2020: Decision is made to transfer posts to Jekyll generated site, and hacking ensues. [https://namecheap.com](Namecheap) is used for hosting, because cheap, but the allure of not controlling my own hosting eventually gets to me. 
 * October 2020: No hosting for the time being. Back to living on my phone.
