# THIS REPO IS NOW IN ARCHIVAL MODE.

> Everything up to this point (2022-03-29) is kept for my posterity [and I kinda wanna revist [ascii](alephalpha0/ascii) sometime later.]

> I have shifted over to [alephalpha0/rootofpi on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/alephalpha0/rootofpi). God speed. (God's peed.)

### ~~[rootofpi.me](#) is living again.~~

> ~~It's my site. :shrug:. Whatta staring at? Take a picture, it'll last longer.~~  

### ~~A short history of rootofpi:~~ 
 * ~~2002ish: Inception. Came from chibidave.net, where I was doing a personal site with some subdomains for friends. Originally rootofpi.org, as I expanded the concept of the site to be a collective.~~ 
 * ~~end of 2003ish to August 2020: domancy period. life happened, didn't have use for a digital domain..~~ 
 * ~~August 2020: rootofpi.me begins the rebirth of my personal space in cyberspace. A nanoc blog is cobbled together prior to this on my phone.~~ 
 * ~~Late August 2020: Decision is made to transfer posts to Jekyll generated site, and hacking ensues. [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) is used for hosting, because cheap, but the allure of not controlling my own hosting eventually gets to me.~~ 
 * ~~October 2020: No hosting for the time being. Back to living on my phone.~~
