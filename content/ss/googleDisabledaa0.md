### So, I might have had a shared GooglePhotos album chock full of every single gay porn video I had downloaded from any number of the copius fag-fuck-flick sites. And there might have been a hefty, near chonk level, group of party fags that were followinng along and accessing the sleazy videos hidden within. 
This _might_ have been against theDataWhoreCorporation's TOS. *Might* have  been. I'm still contesting the action and my spun mentality is willing to take it as far legally as I possibly can. Railing against Reptilian Anti-Privacy & Anti-Consumer Mafia Conglomerates is one of my favorite past-times and it's not like I have shit-all else to occupy my time with.
