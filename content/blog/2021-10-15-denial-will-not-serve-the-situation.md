The meth driven lifestyle I've given my entirety to has once again culminated in another instance of me quickly gathering and packing up my stuff with minimal discussion with - eye contact - or acknowledgment of any other naked tweaker in the room with me; then once my spun-ass has cleared the threshold of whatever sordid dwelling we were currently occupying, the adrenaline finally releases and floods my automatic nervous system and I fucking BOOK it at full throttle.. All the while bringing myself to near hyperventilation.

This time, it was from a homeless nest on the 19th floor of Reunion Hotel in Downtown Dallas.
